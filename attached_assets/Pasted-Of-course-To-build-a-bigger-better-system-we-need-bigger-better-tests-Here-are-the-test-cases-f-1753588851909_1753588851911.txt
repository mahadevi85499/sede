Of course. To build a bigger, better system, we need bigger, better tests. Here are the test cases for the advanced "Restaurant Operating System" features we discussed, in the easy-to-copy format you prefer.

These tests cover the three core pillars: The Customer Experience, the Business Command Center, and the Staff Workflow.

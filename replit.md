# Hotel Management System - Replit Configuration

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Restaurant Operating System (ROS) built with React (Vite), Express, and Firebase Firestore. The application provides a complete dining ecosystem with three specialized interfaces: Customer Experience App (mobile-optimized for ordering, reservations, loyalty rewards), Staff Workflow Panel (real-time order and service management), and Business Command Center (admin dashboard with analytics and inventory control). The system features advanced capabilities including table reservations, order-ahead scheduling, loyalty rewards program, dynamic menu management, and comprehensive feedback system - all with real-time Firebase synchronization.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Data Flow

### Order Process
1. Customer selects items from menu and adds to cart
2. Customer configures order details (packaging, payment mode)
3. Order submitted to Firebase Firestore with timestamp
4. Real-time listeners update Staff and Admin panels instantly
5. Staff processes order and marks as complete
6. Order status updates propagate to all connected clients

### Service Request Flow
1. Customer submits service request via dedicated buttons
2. Request stored in Firestore with table number and timestamp
3. Staff panel displays priority alerts with countdown timers
4. Staff completes service and removes request from system
5. Admin panel maintains oversight of all service activities

### Real-time Synchronization
